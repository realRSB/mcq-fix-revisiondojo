While plasticity continues into adulthood, allowing for lifelong learning and recovery from injury, the rate and extent of this reorganization generally diminish with age. This age-related decline in plasticity is thought to be one of the reasons why learning new, complex skills becomes more challenging later in life and why recovery from brain damage is often slower and less complete in older individuals.\n\nA student claims that the brain's capacity for adaptation changes as a person gets older.

Researchers noted that lower-frequency city sounds, such as traffic rumble, can mask the lower-frequency components of bird songs, making them harder for other birds to hear. By shifting their songs to a higher pitch, the urban sparrows may be adapting to ensure their territorial calls and mating songs are more effectively communicated amidst the urban din. This suggests a remarkable vocal flexibility in these common birds.\n\nIt can be reasonably inferred that the researchers believe the higher-pitched songs of urban sparrows are:",

    "question": "A construction engineer is analyzing the load distribution on a beam. The bending moment M at a distance x from one end of a beam is given by the expression M(x) = 3xÂ³ - 18xÂ² + 27x. The engineer needs to factor this expression to identify critical points where the moment equals zero, as these represent points of zero stress that are important for structural analysis. The factored form will also help determine the maximum load capacity. Which expression is equivalent to 3xÂ³ - 18xÂ² + 27x?",

    "question": "A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothingâno particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as lightâcan escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has a huge effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts as an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the passage?",

    "question": "The United States Federal Reserve, colloquially known as the Fed, serves as the nation's central bank and is tasked with a dual mandate: fostering maximum employment and maintaining stable prices to control inflation. To achieve these goals, it primarily manipulates the federal funds rate, the interest rate at which commercial banks lend to each other overnight. By conducting open market operationsâbuying or selling government securitiesâthe Fed can increase or decrease the total amount of money in the banking system, thereby influencing the federal funds rate. A lower rate encourages borrowing and spending, stimulating the economy but risking inflation. A higher rate discourages borrowing and spending, which can curb inflation but risks slowing economic growth. The Fed must, therefore, perform a delicate balancing act, constantly analyzing economic data to navigate the trade-offs between its two primary objectives.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?",

    "question": "<p><strong><span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\">Text 1</span></strong></p>\n<p>For decades, bluegrass musicians have debated whether their genre should exclude influences from mainstream genres such as rock. Many insist that bluegrass is defined by its adherence to the folk music of the US South, out of which bluegrass emerged. Such &ldquo;purists,&rdquo; as they are known, regard the recordings of Bill Monroe, which established the bluegrass sound in the 1940s, as a standard against which the genre should still be measured.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\">Text 2</span></strong></p>\n<p>Bluegrass isn&rsquo;t simply an extension of folk traditions into the era of recorded music. In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the blues. Since bluegrass has always been a mixed genre, contemporary bluegrass musicians should not be forbidden from incorporating into it influences from rock and other mainstream genres.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely regard the perspective of bluegrass purists, as described in Text 1?</p>",
